## Protect Sensitive Data from AI Exposure

shareSafe is an AI safeguard tool that scans content before sharing with external AI tools to prevent accidental data leaks of sensitive information.

## Problem We Solve

In today's world where AI tools like ChatGPT are widely used in professional environments, accidental sharing of sensitive data has become a serious security concern. Just like Samsung's 2023 internal data leak where an employee pasted confidential source code into ChatGPT, organizations need proactive solutions to prevent such incidents.

## How It Works

1. Paste your content in the scanner
2. Our tool analyzes the text for sensitive information such as:
   - API keys and credentials
   - Internal code and proprietary algorithms
   - Customer or employee personal data
   - Company confidential information
3. Receive alerts about potentially sensitive content before sharing
